    <h1>Scientist of Information</h1>
    <p> This website gives me an opportunity to record some of my 
        experiences while learning more about computer science and 
        software engineering.
    </p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p> As a scientist, I saw more and more of the career opportunities in
        science move away from the traditional discplines and towards software.
        This was not necessarily a bad thing for me as I had been interested in
        computers since I was in high school. In fact, when taking high school math,
        I was more intesete in programming the calculators than learning the math. 
        Fortunately for me, I was also able to excel in math while taking it in college. 
        Eventually, I returned to college for computer science, earning a 
        <strong>Master of Science in Computer Science</strong>.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p> I started my career working in one of the more traditional disciplines in science. 
        After several years of experience in this scientific discipline, I found a 
        job coding information from this discipline's associated literature. 
        Hence the name <strong>Scientist of Information</strong>. 
        After gaining knowledge about my subject area as an information scientist,
        I took on the role of <strong>data steward</strong> for the a
        forementioned subject area.
        As a data steward, I have the opportunity to work with artifacts such as the 
        <strong>Domain Model</strong> and the <strong>Data Dictionary</strong>.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino: While in school for computer science, I became interested in 
            programming arduino microprocessors. I enjoyed the process of coding something
            and watching the results in the physical world.
        </li>
        <li>HTML and CSS: After graduation, I decided to learn more about HTML and CSS
            as a way to implement and expand upon some of the skills that I had 
            learned in college. This website serves as a way to share what I have learned
            while I continue to learn. 
            I am using an iterative process; so these webpages are a work in progress, 
            but every journey requires a first step and I have plaenty of steps to go.
