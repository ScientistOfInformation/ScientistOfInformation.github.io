            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p> As a scientist, I saw more and more of the career opportunities in
                science move away from the traditional discplines and towards software.
                This was not necessarily a bad thing for me as I had been interested in
                computers since I was in high school. In fact, when taking high school math,
                I was more interested in programming the calculators than learning the math. 
                Fortunately for me, I was also able to excel in math while taking it in college. 
                Eventually, I returned to college for computer science, earning a 
                <strong>Master of Science in Computer Science</strong>.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p> I started my career working in one of the more traditional disciplines in science. 
                After several years of experience in this scientific discipline, I found a 
                job coding information from this discipline's associated literature. 
                Hence the name <strong>Scientist of Information</strong>. 
                After gaining knowledge about my subject area as an information scientist,
                I took on the role of <strong>data steward</strong> for the a
                forementioned subject area.
                As a data steward, I have the opportunity to work with artifacts such as the 
                <strong>Domain Model</strong> and the <strong>Data Dictionary</strong>.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Arduino: While in school for computer science, I became interested in 
                    programming arduino microprocessors. I enjoyed the process of coding something
                    and watching the results in the physical world.
                </li>
                <li>HTML and CSS: After graduation, I decided to learn more about HTML and CSS
                    as a way to implement and expand upon some of the skills that I had 
                    learned in college. This website serves as a way to share what I have learned
                    while I continue to learn. 
                    I am using an iterative process; so these webpages are a work in progress, 
                    but every journey requires a first step and I have plaenty of steps to go.
