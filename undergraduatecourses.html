    <h1>Undergraduate Courses</h1>
    <p> I took undergraduate courses in computer science on my path to 
        being accepted into the master's program in computer science.
        I feel that the undergraduate courses that I took as prerequisites 
        for graduate school gave me a sufficiently broad understanding of
        computer science to succeed and I enjoyed learning the concepts.
        
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction to Computer Science and Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p> We practiced <strong>test-driven development</strong> in 
        <strong>Java</strong> using <strong>JUnit</strong>.
        This was a good introduction to object-oriented programming and Java.
    </p>
    <h2>Object-Oriented Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
    <p> This course emphasized <strong>data structures</strong>, 
        <strong>algorithms</strong>, and <strong>design patterns</strong> 
        using <strong>Java</strong>. We continued to use <strong>JUnit</strong>
        for testing.
    </p>
    <h2>Principles of Computer Organization</h2>
    <p> This course emphasized <strong>computer hardware</strong> and 
        <strong>assembly language</strong>.
        I enjoyed using the little man computer was used to learn assembly 
        language. The trick was that we had a limited number of lines to
        accomplish specific tasks using simple commands.
    </p>
    <h2>Database Management</h2>
    <p> This course was a broad survey of database management and there was 
        a lot to remember. We programmed using <strong>SQL</strong> on an
        <strong>Oracle</strong> databse.
    </p>
    <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
    <p> This was a broad survey of the theory behind operating systems.
        We used the <strong>C programming language</strong> for labs
        along with <strong>Pthreads</strong>. 
        This course was also used to improve our understanding of 
        <strong>Linux</strong>. 
        I enjoyed the labs and found myself thinking more 
        about algorithms than I thought I would in this course.
    </p>
    <h2>Discrete Mathematics</h2>
    <p> The math covered this course was helpful for analyzing 
        algorithms and for understanding relational databases.
